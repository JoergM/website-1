## KubePlatform looks awesome. Who is it for?

It is for all those who want to start their next software project well integrated with monitoring, tls and oAuth.

## Why is KubePlatform considered production-ready?

We have several years experience running workloads on Kubernetes and tested KubePlatform ourselves in the field.

## How is KubePlatform different from Kubernetes Production Runtime (BKPR) by Bitnami?

BKPR uses a CLI and Jsonnet files for installing its components, whereas KubePlatform provides a kustomize base and an overlay for GKE.
Also, the set of components is slightly different.

## Are there plans for future components?

At the moment, there are no plans for more components joining KubePlatform.
