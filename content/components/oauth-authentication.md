#### OAuth-based Authentication

When not using __Keycloak__ for identity management the `oauth2-proxy` can be leveraged to connect with an other auth provider. By default, __oauth2-proxy__ supports OAuth with providers such as Google, Azure, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, and LinkedIn. For configuration consult the [GitHub repository of __oauth2-proxy__](https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy).
