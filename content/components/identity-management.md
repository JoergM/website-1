#### Identity Management

`Keycloak` manages authentication and authorization of applications and users. Every application can be secured with __Keycloak__, not only the Monitoring and CI/CD user interfaces which are installed with KubePlatform. See the [Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html) for reference.
